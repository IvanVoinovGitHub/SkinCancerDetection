This project uses Machine Learning to predict diabetes from certain factors (including BP, Cholesterol, Age, Health/Wellbeing, and heart history, among others). All code is created by me, Riyan Jain @InsertWittyCommentHere. 


Notes:

This does not work properly on Github currently. The ML Model would take an upwards of 2-3 minutes to run, so I transferred it to a .PKL file, using the python Pickle library to access and run the code. However, the .PKL file is 946.4 MB, which greatly exceeds the Github max file limit of 25 MB. I am currently working on a solution to this problem.
